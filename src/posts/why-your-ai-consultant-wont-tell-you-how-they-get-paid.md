Every week, another consulting firm announces their "AI transformation practice." Fortune 500 companies, boutique agencies, solo operators with a LinkedIn Premium badge — everyone's selling AI now.

Here's what none of them are telling you: most of them earn commissions from the tools they recommend. And they don't disclose it.

## The conflict nobody talks about

When a consultant recommends HubSpot over Salesforce, or GoHighLevel over Monday.com, there's usually a financial reason behind that recommendation. Partner programs, affiliate commissions, reseller margins — the incentives are real and they're significant. We're talking 20-40% recurring revenue on every client they place.

That's not inherently wrong. Insurance brokers have operated on commission for over a century. The difference? Insurance brokers are legally required to disclose their compensation structure. AI consultants aren't.

## How we handle it

At Ostlii Agency, we get paid two ways: the advisory fee you pay us, and commissions from the tools we recommend. We tell you both numbers before you sign anything.

Why? Because our commission is recurring — we only keep earning if you keep using the tool. If we recommend something that doesn't work, we lose that revenue. Our financial incentive is aligned with your outcome, and we want you to see that math for yourself.

## What to ask before you hire anyone

If you're evaluating AI consultants, implementation partners, or "transformation advisors," ask them three questions:

Do you earn commissions or referral fees from the tools you recommend? If so, how much? Will you recommend a free tool if it solves my problem?

The ones worth hiring will answer all three without flinching. The rest will change the subject.
